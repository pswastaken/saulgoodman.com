## 📖 Project Overview

**Unpopular opinion: Superhero POVs are overrated,** so we decided on one of the most iconic characters of the TV drama series *Better Call Saul*.

**Saul Goodman** is an absolute icon and a really fun character, but our POV shows the user as a **potential client**. The webpage is a personified version of Saul's personality—witty and humorous aside from being a good lawyer.

The website theme is based on the **late 90's, early 2000's pop colour style**. The project is full of **interactive and visual bloopers**, and for the full experience, we recommend you explore the whole web page.
